# Contributing to Feersum

Feersum is open source software. Contributions are welcome. Please follow a few
simple guidelines to make your contribution extra awesome:

 * Small contributions can be submitted as pull requests.
 * [Open an issue][open_issue] and discuss
   larger changes before cutting code.

## Keep it Small or Discuss First

Seen as I'm sharing the development of this compiler I'd like to reserve the
option to tackle larger issues on stream. If you'd like to make a significant
refactoring to the codebase, or contribute a significant new feature please
[open an issue][open_issue] first so we can discuss. If it isn't on the roadmap
on [the main README][readme] chances are it will be welcome.

## Quick Fixes

I am notoriously bad at:

 * typing
 * reading what I have typed.

If you find something _super simple_ that's been nagging you then _please_ open
a PR to fix it.

## Up for Grabs

Some issues are marked [up for grabs][up-for-grabs]. These issues are not
currently claimed and are free to be worked on. If you'd like to tackle one then
shout out in the comments on the issue and I'd be happy to assign it to yo.
